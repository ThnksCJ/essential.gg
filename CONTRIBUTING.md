# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first create a branch with a simple name that 
describes the feature you are working on. For example, if you are working on P.I.G, you might 
create a branch called `P.I.G/feature-name`, if it's on the protocol, you might call it
`protocol/feature-name` and so on.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies ('node_modules', 'out') are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Describe your changes in the Pull Request, why they are necessary, and if it's a new feature, how to use it.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
